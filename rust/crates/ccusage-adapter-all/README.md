# ccusage-adapter-all

The unified `ccusage` report: it loads every agent adapter and merges their rows
into one table or JSON document.

## Owns

- `loader.rs` — per-agent loading, the agent selection the CLI asks for, and the
  merge into shared rows.
- `report.rs` — the unified row and total shapes.
- `types.rs` — the accumulators the merge needs.

This is the only crate that depends on all 17 adapters, which keeps the adapters
themselves independent of each other.

## Public surface

- `run`

## Build layer

Built in the `adapters` Crane artifact layer; the layer compiles all adapters in one Cargo invocation, so they build concurrently. Because it depends on every adapter, a change to any adapter also
recompiles this crate.
