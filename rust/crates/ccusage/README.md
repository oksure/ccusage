# ccusage

The distributed binary. It stays thin on purpose: argument parsing lives in
`ccusage-cli-parser`, shared runtime behavior in `ccusage-core`, and every data
source in its own `ccusage-adapter-*` crate, including DeepSeek Harness (`dsh`).

## Owns

- `main.rs` — startup, command dispatch, and the version string the release
  embeds through `CCUSAGE_VERSION`.
- `cli.rs` — the parse entry point and the config context it passes to the parser.
- `commands/` — the command implementations that are not an agent report, such as
  `blocks` and `statusline`.
- `adapter/` — the thin aliases that map each `ccusage <agent>` subcommand to its
  adapter crate.
- `bin/generate_config_schema.rs` — writes `apps/ccusage/config-schema.json`; the
  `config-schema` flake check fails when the committed file drifts.

## Build layer

Outside the Crane artifact layers: it is compiled with the final binary, so editing it leaves the cached layers untouched. Its link step is the dominant cost of a warm build, because the release
profile uses fat LTO with a single codegen unit.
