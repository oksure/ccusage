# Crane artifact layers for the workspace, on top of the dependency-only cache.
#
# The layers are a linear chain — dependencies -> foundation -> adapters -> final
# binary — rather than one derivation per adapter. Each layer only extends the
# previous one, so Crane's full-archive install works everywhere, including
# Darwin, where it cannot install incremental archives
# (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/115982) and merging sibling archives
# would overwrite shared path-crate artifacts with incompatible variants.
#
# The adapters share one layer because they are mutually independent: a single
# `cargoBuild` with one `-p` per crate lets Cargo compile them concurrently, so
# the layer's wall clock is roughly the slowest single adapter. Splitting them
# into sibling derivations instead adds several serial Nix round-trips — sandbox
# setup, unpacking the dependency target directory, and writing a store archive
# per layer — which costs more than recompiling the unchanged adapters.
